## Data Requirements
This article uses a performance from the Saraga Dataset of the composition Kamakshi by Carnatic vocalist, Sanjay Subrahmanyan in raga Bhairavi [1]. We present as part of this work, note-level annotations for this performance - [data/annotations/kamakshi.txt](data/annotations/kamakshi.txt)

## Repository Structure

### Data
All svara pitch plots, audios and static features can be found in `results/svara_plots`

### Code and Scripts
The scripts to reproduce the paper results can be found in `experiments` 

### Paper Results
The clustering results can be found in `results/clustering`. The application code for the svara-form explorer is found in `app/` . The visualisation can be found online here - [https://svara-clustering.onrender.com/](https://svara-clustering.onrender.com/). The hosting is provided using the free onrender servers and as such if the site has not been visited for a long time, it may take several minutes to load.

### SHAP Analysis
The SHAP analysis results can be found in `results/SHAP`. Further details are provided in that folder.
